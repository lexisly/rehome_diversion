Abstract

With research showing that animals experience significant distress in animal shelters, leaders are calling for increased efforts to divert intake of companion animals away from shelters through community programs. One novel intake diversion strategy is self-supported rehoming, where owners can find new homes for their animals without surrendering the animal to a physical shelter. This study aimed to understand what factors predict successful diversion (i.e., adoption or retention) of animals through Adopt-a-Pet’s ‘Rehome’ program. Data for dogs (n = 100,342) and cats (n=48,484) listed on ‘Rehome’ from January 1, 2017, until May 21, 2021, were analyzed through logistic regression to assess the association of animal-related (e.g., age, breed, behavioural tendencies) and owner-related (deadline for rehoming, reason for rehoming) factors and outcome (diversion versus relinquishment to a shelter). Overall, 87.1% of dogs and 85.7% of cats were diverted from animal shelters through ‘Rehome’. Of the diverted animals, 37.8% of dogs and 35.3% of cats were kept by their original owner, while the rest were rehomed. Multiple animal-related factors like those important in predicting successful adoption from shelters predicted increased odds of diversion (e.g., younger, smaller animals). Dog and cat owners who set a longer rehoming deadline (i.e., > 8 weeks) were over twice as likely to keep or adopt their animal. Dog owners who surrendered for owner-related surrender reasons had increased odds of diversion in comparison to animal behaviour issues. These results provide guidance for animal shelter professionals on the likelihood of successful diversion programs given certain animal and owner characteristics.
